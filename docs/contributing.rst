Submitting changes
==================

- Code should be accompanied by tests and documentation. Maintain our excellent
  test coverage.

  complain about anything.

- Write good commit messages. Here's three blog posts on how to do it right:

  - `Writing Git commit messages
    <http://365git.tumblr.com/post/3308646748/writing-git-commit-messages>`_

  - `A Note About Git Commit Messages
    <http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html>`_

  - `On commit messages
    <http://who-t.blogspot.ch/2009/12/on-commit-messages.html>`_

- One branch per feature or fix. Keep branches small and on topic.

- Send a pull request to the ``v1/develop`` branch. See the `GitHub pull
  request docs <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`_ for
  help.
